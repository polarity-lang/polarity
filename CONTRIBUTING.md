## Testsuite

We have two kinds of tests: unit tests and integration tests.
Unit tests use the [default testing infrastructure](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-01-writing-tests.html) that is provided by Rust and Cargo.
Integration tests use polarity source files as input and perform various checks on them.
They are executed using the custom test runner that is implemented in the `test/test-runner` directory.


> [!TIP]
> You can run *all* unit and integration tests using the `make test` target of the Makefile, or manually using `cargo test --workspace`.

There are two different kinds of integration tests: tests which verify that certain files successfully typecheck, and tests which verify that certain files fail to typecheck.

We have three different testsuites which verify that polarity files typecheck.
For each of those files we first verify that they typecheck, then we verify that they can still be parsed after they have been prettyprinted, and then we check whether the result of de-/refunctionalizing any of the contained data and codata types still typechecks.
The examples come from three different directories:

- All examples in the `example/` directory are tested.
- All files in the standard library in the `std/` directory are tested.
- All files in the `test/suites/success` directory are tested.

In order to verify that incorrect files are rejected by the compiler we have three different testsuites:

- All examples in `test/suites/fail-parse` must be rejected by the compiler during the parsing stage.
- All examples in `test/suites/fail-lower` must be rejected during the lowering phase.
- All examples in `test/suites/fail-check` must be rejected during the elaboration phase.

In order to guarantee that we don't have regressions in the quality of our error messages we use `foo.expected` files for every `foo.pol` example in the failing test suites.
Each such file, if it is present, contains the textual error message that we expect the compiler to emit.

> [!TIP]
> If you change the text of an error message that is emitted then you also have to update the `.expected` files. You can do that manually or use the `make update-expected` target we provide.

## Code Coverage

We do monitor the code coverage provided by our testsuite in order to diagnose which parts of the codebase are not tested sufficiently, but we do not implement coverage thresholds that a pull request needs to fulfil in order to be merged.
You can inspect the current coverage of the main branch through the web interface of codecov using [this link](https://app.codecov.io/gh/polarity-lang/polarity).

> [!TIP]
> You can also compute code coverage locally. To do this, first install the `llvm-cov` subcommand for cargo using `cargo install cargo-llvm-cov`. You can then run `make coverage` to get a html report of the parts of the code that are covered by tests.

## Debugging

The compiler uses the [log crate](https://crates.io/crates/log) to trace useful diagnostic information during its execution.
Which logs are emitted is controlled through environment variables and the [env-logger crate](https://crates.io/crates/env_logger).
The documentation of that crate provides documentation for all available options.
The two flags `--trace` and `--debug` can also be used to configure the output.


> [!TIP]
> A simple invocation which writes debug information to the console is:
>
> ```sh
> RUST_LOG=trace pol run examples/example.pol
> ```


The testsuite uses the same logging infrastructure as the main application, so any options used for the `pol` binary should also work for the `test-runner` binary.

## Web Editor

We provide a web editor which can typecheck and de/refunctionalize examples on [polarity-lang.github.io](https://polarity-lang.github.io/) which is implemented in the `web/` directory.
The web editor works by compiling polarity using the WebAssembly backend of the Rust compiler.
The resulting web assembly code is combined with the [Monaco editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/); most of this glue code is written in TypeScript, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The respective [README](web/README.md) provides more detailed information on how to work on the web demo.

## Linters and Formatters

Every pull request must adhere to the code formatting standard implemented by `cargo fmt`, and must not produce warnings when linted with `cargo clippy`.

> [!TIP]
> You can run the formatter and all linters using `make lint`, or use the git pre-commit hook provided in `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`.

## Conventions

As a convention, we order Rust `use` statements in the following order:

1. `std` imports
2. Imports from external crates (except workspace crates)
3. Imports from workspace crates
4. Imports from the current crate

Example:

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;    // Import from std

use url::Url;       // Import from external crate

use parser::cst;    // Import from workspace crate

use crate::info;    // Import from current crate
```

Currently, this is not statically enforced because [rustfmt doesn't support it](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustfmt/issues/5083).

## Pull Requests

All changes to the codebase should go through pull-requests.
We do not allow commits directly on the `main` branch of the repository.
Furthermore, all pull requests should be associated with at least one specific issue unless the PR fixes a minor problem.
Please check that you observe the following guidelines:

- If your PR changes the observable behaviour of the binary, then you have to add an entry to the `CHANGELOG.md` file with your PR under the `Unreleased` section of the changelog.
- Every PR needs to have at least 1 approval before it can be merged.
- We enforce a linear history on the `main` branch, so every PR must either be rebased or rebased and squashed before it is merged into `main`.

## Releases

> [!CAUTION]
> We do not provide versioned releases yet, so this section can be ignored for now.

We use the following workflow for generating a new release for version `x.x.x`:

- Open a branch with the name `prepare-release-x.x.x` and create a corresponding PR.
- Change the versions in all the `Cargo.toml` files to the new version `x.x.x`, build the project, and also commit the generated `Cargo.lock` file.
- Move everything under the section `Unreleased` in the `CHANGELOG.md` into a new section `[x.x.x] YYYY-MM-DD` with the current date.
- Merge the Pull request into `main`.
- In the main branch, use `git tag -a x.x.x -m "Version x.x.x` to create a tag, and `git push origin x.x.x` to publish the tag.
